<h1> shibari </h1>

<h2> What is it&nbsp;? </h2>

<p>
 shibari is a collection of DNS tools for Unix systems, as an
alternative to BIND, Unbound, djbdns or other similar suites of
programs.
</p>

<p>
 It is an ongoing project; at the moment, only a DNS server is
provided (one program to serve over TCP, another to serve over UDP).
Currently, it relies on the
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-dns/">s6-dns</a> library, but it
aims to integrate it over time, and eventually completely replace
s6-dns (which is a badly named software collection, because despite
being written by the same author and with the same mindset, it is not
part of the s6 project).
</p>

<h3> Why "shibari"? </h3>

<p>
 There's a tradition that DNS software should have a name related to binding.
So, might as well make it pleasant.

<h3> Requirements </h3>

<ul>
 <li> A POSIX-compliant system with a standard C development environment </li>
 <li> GNU make, version 3.81 or later </li>
 <li> <a href="//skarnet.org/software/skalibs/">skalibs</a> version
